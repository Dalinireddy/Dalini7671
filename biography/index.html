                <h2>Rebel Star</h2>
                <p>Prabhas began his acting career in 2002 with the Telugu movie Eeshwar. With his 2004 release Varsham, he enjoyed fame, where he featured with Trisha Krishnan. He acted in Adavi Ramudu and Chakram after Varsham.

                    In 2005, he switched to the strong performance in the blockbuster Chatrapathhi movie where Shriya Saran played the opposite role. After Chatrapati he acted in the films, such as Yogi, Pournami, and Munna. Bujjigadu, his 2008 release, brought him much needed success.
                    
                    He appeared in a few moderate hit films including Mr Perfect, Rebel & Mirchi among others from 2008 to 2014. He appeared in 2015 Epic Baahubali of S.S. Rajamouli: The Beginning. This film has accumulated worldwide commercial and critical recognition.
                    
                    Shortly after the first part, its sequel became the most anticipated film. The sequel was released in March 2017. The film was screened on 900 screens and shows were booked beforehand for the first week.
                    
                    The film is sort like a prequel than a continuation, and Prabhas acted in this film by keeping all his efforts. He was then seen in Saaho bilingual suspense movie alongwith Shraddha Kapoor. This film will mark his film debut in Bollywood.
                    
                    He has overcome Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan’s likes and got a statue as Amarendra Baahubali, based on his Baahubali role and also like wearing the armour of the war. In the past, Prabhas stated he never thought of being an actor, and just wanted to be a hotelier in fact.</p>
